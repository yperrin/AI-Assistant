Evals are having their moment.

It’s  become one of the most talked-about concepts in AI product development.
 People argue about it for hours, write thread after thread, and treat 
it as the answer to every quality problem. This is a dramatic shift from
 2024 or even early 2025, when the term was barely known. Now everyone 
knows evaluation matters. Everyone wants to “**build good evals**.“

But  now they’re lost. There’s so much noise coming from all directions, 
with everyone using the term for completely different things. Some 
(might we say, most) people think “evals” means prompting AI models to 
judge other AI models, building a dashboard of them that will magically 
solve their quality problems. They don’t understand that what they 
actually need is a process, one that’s far more nuanced and 
comprehensive than spinning up a few automated graders.

We’ve started to really hate the term. It’s bringing more confusion than 
clarity. Evals are only important in the context of product quality, and
 product quality is a process. It’s the ongoing discipline of deciding 
what “good” means for your product, measuring it in the right ways at 
the right times, learning where it breaks in the real world, and 
repeatedly closing the loop with fixes that stick.

We recently talked about this on *[Lenny’s Podcast](https://youtu.be/z7T1pCxgvlA?si=wpFGuurnmdNpNUOc&t=2001)*,
 and so many people reached out saying they related to the confusion, 
that they’d been struggling with the same questions. That’s why we’re 
writing this post.

Here’s what this article is going to do: 
explain the entire system you need to build for AI product quality, 
without using the word “evals.” (We’ll try our best. :p)

The status quo for shipping any reliable product requires ensuring three things:

- **Offline quality**: A way to estimate how it behaves while you’re still developing it, before any customer sees it

- **Online quality**: Signals for how it’s actually performing once real customers are using it

- **Continuous improvement**: A reliable feedback loop that lets you find problems, fix them, and get better over time

This article is about how to ensure these three things in the context of AI 
products: why AI is different from traditional software, and what you 
need to build instead.

## **Why Traditional Testing Breaks**

In traditional software, testing handles all three things we just described.

Think about booking a hotel on Booking.com. You select your dates from a 
calendar. You pick a city from a dropdown. You filter by price range, 
star rating, and amenities. At every step, you’re clicking on predefined
 options. The system knows exactly what inputs to expect, and the 
engineers can anticipate almost every path you might take. If you click 
the ”search” button with valid dates and a valid city, the system 
returns hotels. The behavior is predictable.

This predictability means testing covers everything:

- **Offline quality?** You write unit tests and integration tests before launch to verify behavior.

- **Online quality?** You monitor production for errors and exceptions. When something
breaks, you get a stack trace that tells you exactly what went wrong.

- **Continuous improvement?** It’s almost automatic. You write a new test, fix the bug, and ship.
When you fix something, it stays fixed. Find issue, fix issue, move on.

Now imagine the same task, but through a chat interface: ”I need a 
pet-friendly hotel in Austin for next weekend, under $200, close to 
downtown but not too noisy.”

The problem becomes much more complex. And the traditional testing approach falls apart.

The way users interact with the system can’t be anticipated upfront. 
There’s no dropdown constraining what they type. They can phrase their 
request however they want, include context you didn’t expect, or ask for
 things your system was never designed to handle. You can’t write test 
cases for inputs you can’t predict.

And because there’s an AI model at the center of this, the outputs are nondeterministic. The model
 is probabilistic. You can’t assert that a specific input will always 
produce a specific output. There’s no single ”correct answer” to check 
against.

On top of that, the process itself is a black box. With traditional software, you can trace exactly why an output was produced. 
You wrote the code; you know the logic. With an LLM, you can’t. You feed
 in a prompt, something happens inside the model, and you get a 
response. If it’s wrong, you don’t get a stack trace. You get a 
confident-sounding answer that might be subtly or completely incorrect.

This is the core challenge: AI products have a much larger surface area of 
user input that you can’t predict upfront, processed by a 
nondeterministic system that can produce outputs you never anticipated, 
through a process you can’t fully inspect***.***

The traditional feedback loop breaks down. You can’t estimate behavior 
during development because you can’t anticipate all the inputs. You 
can’t easily catch issues in production because there’s no clear error 
signal, just a response that might be wrong. And you can’t reliably 
improve because the thing you fix might not stay fixed when the input 
changes slightly.

Whatever you tested before launch was based on 
behavior you anticipated. And that anticipated behavior can’t be 
guaranteed once real users arrive.

This is why we need a different approach to determining quality for AI products. The testing paradigm that works for clicking through Booking.com doesn’t transfer to chatting
 with an AI. You need something different.

## **Model Versus Product**

So we’ve established that AI products are fundamentally harder to test 
than traditional software. The inputs are unpredictable, the outputs are
 nondeterministic, and the process is opaque. This is why we need 
dedicated approaches to measuring quality.

But there’s another layer of complexity that causes confusion: the distinction between 
assessing the model and assessing the product.

Foundation AI models are judged for quality by the companies that build them. OpenAI, 
Anthropic, and Google all run their models through extensive testing 
before release. They measure how well the model performs on coding 
tasks, reasoning problems, factual questions, and dozens of other 
capabilities. They give the model a set of inputs, check whether it 
produces expected outputs or takes expected actions, and use that to 
assess quality.

This is where benchmarks come from. You’ve 
probably seen them: LMArena, MMLU scores, HumanEval results. Model 
providers publish these numbers to show how their model stacks up. 
“We’re #1 on this benchmark” is a common marketing claim.

These scores represent real testing. The model was given specific tasks and 
its performance was measured. But here’s the thing: These scores have 
limited use for people building products. Model companies are racing 
toward capability parity. The gaps between top models are shrinking. 
What you actually need to know is whether the model will work for your 
specific product and produce good quality responses in your context.

There are two distinct layers here:

**The model layer**.
 This is the foundation model itself: GPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever 
you’re building on. It has general capabilities that have been tested by
 its creators. It can reason, write code, answer questions, follow 
instructions. The benchmarks measure these general capabilities.

**The product layer**.
 This is your application, the thing you’re actually shipping to users. A
 customer support bot. A booking assistant. Your product is built on top
 of a foundation model, but it’s not the same thing. It has specific 
requirements, specific users, and specific definitions of success. It 
integrates with your tools, operates under your constraints, and handles
 use cases the benchmark creators never anticipated. Your product lives 
in a custom ecosystem that no model provider could possibly simulate.

Benchmark scores tell you what a model can do in general. They don’t tell you whether it works for your product.

The model layer has already been assessed by someone else. Your job is to 
assess the product layer: against your specific requirements, your 
specific users, your specific definition of success.

We bring this up because so many people obsess over model performance 
benchmarks. They spend weeks comparing leaderboards, trying to find the 
“best” model, and end up in “model selection hell.” The truth is, you 
need to pick something reasonable and build your own quality assessment 
framework. You cannot heavily rely on provider benchmarks to tell you 
what works for your product.

## **What You Measure Against**

So you need to assess your product’s quality. Against what, exactly?

Three things work together:

**Reference examples**:
 Real inputs paired with known-good outputs. If a user asks, “What’s 
your return policy?“ what should the system say? You need concrete 
examples of questions and acceptable answers. These become your ground 
truth, the standard you’re measuring against.

Start with 10–50 
high-quality examples that cover your most important scenarios. A small 
set of carefully chosen examples beats a large set of sloppy ones. You 
can expand later as you learn what actually matters in practice.

This is really just product intuition. You’re thinking: What does my product
 support? How would users interact with it? What user personas exist? 
How should my ideal product behave? You’re designing the experience and 
gathering a reference for what “good“ looks like.

**Metrics**:
 Once you have reference examples, you need to think about how to 
measure quality. What dimensions matter? This is also product intuition.
 These dimensions are your metrics. Usually, if you’ve built out your 
reference example dataset very well, they should give you an overview of
 what metrics to look into based on the behavior that you want to see. 
Metrics essentially are dimensions that you want to focus on to assess 
quality. An example of a dimension could be, say, helpfulness.

**Rubrics**:
 What does “good“ actually mean for each metric? This is a step that 
often gets skipped. It’s common to say “we’re measuring helpfulness“ 
without defining what helpful means in context. Here’s the thing: 
Helpfulness for a customer support bot is different from helpfulness for
 a legal assistant. A helpful support bot should be concise, solve the 
problem quickly, and escalate at the right time. A helpful legal 
assistant should be thorough and explain all the nuances. A rubric makes
 this explicit. It’s the instructions that your metric hinges on. You 
need this documented so everyone knows what they’re actually measuring. 
Sometimes if metrics are more objective in nature—for instance, “Was a 
correct JSON retrieved?“ or “Was a particular tool called done 
correctly?”—you don’t need rubrics at all. Subjective metrics are the 
ones that you generally need rubrics for, so keep that in mind.

For example, a customer support bot might define helpfulness like this:

- **Excellent**: Resolves the issue completely in one response, uses clear language, offers next steps if relevant

- **Adequate**: Answers the question but requires follow-up or includes unnecessary information

- **Poor**: Misunderstands the question, gives irrelevant information, or fails to address the core issue

To summarize, you have expected behavior from the user, expected behavior 
from the system (your reference examples), metrics (the dimensions 
you’re assessing), and rubrics (how you define those metrics). A metric 
like “helpfulness“ is just a word and means nothing unless it’s grounded
 by the rubric. All of this gets documented, which helps you start 
judging offline quality before you ever go into production.

## **How You Measure**

You’ve defined what you’re measuring against. Now, how do you actually measure it?

There are three approaches, and all of them have their place.

![image-7.png](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/image-7.png)

**Code-based checks**:
 Deterministic rules that can be verified programmatically. Did the 
response include a required disclaimer? Is it under the word limit? Did 
it return valid JSON? Did it refuse to answer when it should have? These
 checks are simple, fast, cheap, and reliable. They won’t catch 
everything, but they catch the straightforward stuff. You should always 
start here.

**LLM as judge**: Using one model to 
grade another. You provide a rubric and ask the model to score 
responses. This scales better than human review and can assess 
subjective qualities like tone or helpfulness.

But there’s a risk.
 An LLM judge that hasn’t been calibrated against human judgment can 
lead you astray. It might consistently rate things wrong. It might have 
blind spots that match the blind spots of the model you’re grading. If 
your judge doesn’t agree with humans on what “good“ looks like, you’re 
optimizing for the wrong thing. Calibration against human judgment is 
super critical.

**Human review**: The gold standard. 
Humans assess quality directly, either through expert review or user 
feedback. It’s slow and expensive and doesn’t scale. But it’s necessary.
 You need human judgment to calibrate your LLM judges, to catch things 
automated checks miss, and to make final calls on high-stakes decisions.

The right approach: Start with code-based checks for everything you can 
automate. Add LLM judges carefully, with extensive calibration. Reserve 
human review for where it matters most.

One important note: When 
you’re first building your reference examples, have humans do the 
grading. Don’t jump straight to LLM judges. LLM judges are notorious for
 being miscalibrated, and you need a human baseline to calibrate 
against. Get humans to judge first, understand what “good“ looks like 
from their perspective, and then use that to calibrate your automated 
judges. Calibrating LLM judges is a whole other blog post. We won’t dig 
into it here. But this is a nice [guide](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/cookbook/prompt-engineering/llm-as-a-judge-prompt-optimization) from Arize to help you get started.

## **Production Surprises You (and Humbles You)**

Let’s say you’re building a customer support bot. You’ve built your reference
 dataset with 50 (or 100 or 200—whatever that number is, this still 
applies) example conversations. You’ve defined metrics for helpfulness, 
accuracy, and appropriate escalation. You’ve set up code checks for 
response length and required disclaimers, calibrated an LLM judge 
against human ratings, and run human review on the tricky cases. Your 
offline quality looks solid. You ship. Then real users show up. Here are
 just some examples of emerging behaviors you might see. The real world 
is a lot more nuanced.

- **Your reference examples don’t cover what users actually ask.** You anticipated questions about return policies, shipping times, and
order status. But users ask about things you didn’t include: “Can I
return this if my dog chewed on the box?“ or “My package says delivered
but I never got it, and also I’m moving next week.“ They combine
multiple issues in one message. They reference previous conversations.
They phrase things in ways your reference examples never captured.

- **Users find scenarios you missed.** Maybe your bot handles refund requests well but struggles when users
ask about partial refunds on bundled items. Maybe it works fine in
English but breaks when users mix in Spanish. No matter how thorough
your prelaunch testing, real users will find gaps.

- **User behavior shifts over time.** The questions you get in month one don’t look like the questions you
get in month six. Users learn what the bot can and can’t do. They
develop workarounds. They find new use cases. Your reference examples
were a snapshot of expected behavior, but expected behavior changes.

And then there’s scale. If you’re handling 5,000 conversations a day with a
 95% success rate, that’s still 250 failures every day. You can’t 
manually review everything.

This is the gap between offline and online quality. Your offline assessment gave you confidence to ship. It told you the system worked on the examples you anticipated. But online 
quality is about what happens with real users, real scale, and real 
unpredictability. The work of figuring out what’s actually breaking and 
fixing it starts the moment real users arrive.

This is where you realize a few things (a.k.a. lessons):

**Lesson 1: Production will surprise you regardless of your best efforts.**
 You can build metrics and measure them before deployment, but it’s 
almost impossible to think of all cases. You’re bound to be surprised in
 production.

**Lesson 2: Your metrics might need updates. 
They’re not “once done and throw.“ You might need to update rubrics or 
add entirely new metrics.** Since your predeployment metrics 
might not capture all kinds of issues, you need to rely on online 
implicit and explicit signals too: Did the user show frustration? Did 
they drop off the call? Did they leave a thumbs down? These signals help
 you sample bad experiences so you can make fixes. And if needed, you 
can implement new metrics to track how a dimension is doing. Maybe you 
didn’t have a metric for handling out-of-scope requests. Maybe 
escalation accuracy should be a new metric.

Over time, you also realize that some metrics become less useful because user behavior has 
changed. This is where the flywheel becomes important.

## **The Flywheel**

This is the part most people miss and pay least attention to but you should be paying the *most*
 attention to. Measuring quality isn’t a phase you complete before 
launch. It’s not a gate you pass through once. It’s an engine that runs 
continuously, for the entire life of your product.

Here’s how it works:

**Monitor production.**
 You can’t review everything, so you sample intelligently. Flag 
conversations that look unusual: long exchanges, repeated questions, 
user frustration signals, low confidence scores. These are the 
interactions worth examining.

**Discover new failure modes.**
 When you review flagged interactions, you find problems your prelaunch 
testing missed. Maybe users are asking about a topic you didn’t 
anticipate. Maybe the system handles a certain phrasing poorly. These 
are new failure modes, gaps in your understanding of what can go wrong.

**Update your metrics and reference data.**
 Every new failure mode becomes a new thing to measure. You can either 
fix the issue and move on, or if you have a sense that the issue needs 
to be monitored for future interactions, add a new metric or a set of 
rubrics to an existing metric. Add examples to your reference dataset. 
Your quality system gets smarter because production taught you what to 
look for.

**Ship improvements and repeat.** Fix the issues, push the changes, and start monitoring again. The cycle continues.

This is the flywheel: Production informs quality measurement, quality 
measurement guides improvement, improvement changes production, and 
production reveals new gaps. It keeps running. . . (Until your product 
reaches a convergence point. How often you need to run it depends on 
your online signals: Are users satisfied, or are there anomalies?)

![image-8.png](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/image-8.png)

**And your metrics have a lifecycle.**

Not all metrics serve the same purpose:

**Capability metrics** (borrowing the term from [Anthropic’s blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents))
 measure things you’re actively trying to improve. They should start at a
 low pass rate (maybe 40%, maybe 60%). These are the hills you’re 
climbing. If a capability metric is already at 95%, it’s not telling you
 where to focus.

**Regression metrics** (again borrowing the term from [Anthropic’s blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents))
 protect what you’ve already achieved. These should be near 100%. If a 
regression metric drops, something broke. You need to investigate 
immediately. As you improve on capability metrics, the things you’ve 
mastered become regression metrics.

**Saturated metrics**
 have stopped giving you signal. They’re always green. They’re no longer
 informing decisions. When a metric saturates, run it less frequently or
 retire it entirely. It’s noise, not signal.

Metrics should be 
born when you discover new failure modes, evolve as you improve, and 
eventually be retired when they’ve served their purpose. **A static set of metrics that never changes is a sign that your quality system has stagnated.**

## **So What Are “Evals“?**

As promised, we made it through without using the word “evals.“ Hopefully 
this gives a glimpse into the lifecycle: assessing quality before 
deployment, deploying with the right level of confidence, connecting 
production signals to metrics, and building a flywheel.

Now, the issue with the word “evals“ is that people use it for all sorts of things:

- “We should build evals“ → Usually means “we should write LLM judges“ (useless if not calibrated and not part of the flywheel).

- “Evals are dead; A/B testing is key“ → This is part of the flywheel. Some
companies overindex on online signals and fix issues without many
offline metrics. Might or might not make sense based on product.

- “How are GPT-5.2 evals looking?“ → These are model benchmarks, often not useful for product builders.

- “How many evals do you have?“ → Might refer to data samples, metrics… We don’t know what.

And more!

Here’s the deal: Everything we walked through (distinguishing model from 
product, building reference examples and rubrics, measuring with code 
and LLM judges and humans, monitoring production, running the continuous
 improvement flywheel, managing the lifecycle of your metrics) is what 
“evals“ should mean. But we don’t think one term should carry so much 
weight. We don’t want to use the term anymore. We want to point to 
different parts in the flywheel and have a fruitful conversation 
instead.

And that’s why **evals are not all you need**. It’s a larger data science and monitoring problem. Think of quality assessment as an ongoing discipline, not a checklist item.

We could have titled this article “Evals Are All You Need.“ But depending 
on your definition, that might not get you to read this article, because
 you think you already know what evals are. And it might be just a 
piece. If you’ve read this far, you understand why.

**Final note:** Build the flywheel, not the checkbox. Not the dashboard. Whatever you need to build that actionable flywheel of improvement.
